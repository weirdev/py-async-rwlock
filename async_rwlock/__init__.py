    """Async reader-writer lock around a single shared value.

    The value returned by :meth:`read` is the underlying reference; callers must
    treat it as immutable unless they hold the write lock.

    Example with a mutable value (replace rather than mutate in-place):

    >>> async with lock.read() as items:
    ...     snapshot = items
    >>> async with lock.write() as writer:
    ...     writer.set_value(snapshot + ["new-item"])

    Note that once a writer acquires the write lock, no new readers can acquire
    the read lock until the writer releases the write lock.
    However, in highly contended scenarios, it is theoretically possible for many readers
    to starve writers (and equally other readers) indefinitely. 
    RwLock has the same fairness properties as asyncio.Lock.
